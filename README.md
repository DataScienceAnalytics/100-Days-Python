# 100-Days-Python
A 100 Days Python Challenge
- Even though I have been programming in Python for over 4 years as a data scientist, sometimes it's not easy to implement fast and efficient code without reviewing some of the past scripts or techniques I used.
- The goal of this 100 days challenge is to further fine tune my python techniques by gaining the python coding "muscle" on a daily basis and become a pro.
